  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
</section>
<section>
  <p>
    In this section you'll learn how to get started with a MEAN.JS application, install all the prerequisites, and initialize your application.
  </p>

  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>
    Before you begin, you should make sure you have installed all these prerequisites on your development machine.
  </p>
  <br>
  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>Git</dt>
    <dd>
     Make sure you have <a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> installed in your system. OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed. You can see if it is installed by typing:
      <pre>$ git --version</pre>
    </dd>
    <dt>Node.js &amp; npm</dt>
    <dd>
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nodejs.org/download">Download &amp; Install</a> Node.js and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814">Github Gist</a> to install Node.js.
    </dd>
    <dt>MongoDB</dt>
    <dd>
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mongodb.org/downloads">Download &amp; Install</a> MongoDB, and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
    </dd>
    <dt>Bower</dt>
    <dd>
      You're going to use the <a target="_blank" href="http://bower.io">Bower Package Manager</a> to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm:
      <pre>$ npm install -g bower</pre>
    </dd>
    <dt>Grunt</dt>
    <dd>
      You're going to use the <a target="_blank" href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt Task Runner</a> to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm:
      <pre>$ npm install -g grunt-cli</pre>
    </dd>
    <dt>Gulp (Optional)</dt>
    <dd>
      You may use the <a target="_blank" href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp Task Runner</a> instead of Grunt.  You may use Gulp for Live Reload, Linting, and SASS or LESS compilation.
      <pre>$ npm install -g gulp</pre>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p class="alert alert-info">
    <b>Note:</b> Your user might not have the permissions to install package globally, so use a super user or <b>sudo</b>.
  </p>
  <h2>Downloading MEAN.JS</h2>
  <p>
    There are several ways you can get the MEAN.JS boilerplate:
  </p>
  <h3>Yo Generator</h3>
  <p>Although the meanjs generator is released, the sub generators are still under development. See the <a href="https://github.com/meanjs/generator-meanjs">Generator Repo</a> for information on how to use the meanjs generator.
  </p>
  <p class="alert alert-info">
    <b>Note:</b> If you want to support
    <em>git merge</em> updates it would be better to use
    <em>git clone</em> for your initial project creation, don't worry you'd still be able to use the generator.
  </p>
  <h3>Cloning The GitHub Repository</h3>
  <p>
    You can also use Git to directly clone the MEAN.JS repository:
  </p>
  <pre>$ git clone https://github.com/meanjs/mean.git meanjs</pre>
  <p>
    This will clone the latest version of the MEAN.JS repository to a meanjs folder.
  </p>
  <h3>Downloading The Repository Zip File</h3>
  <p>
    Another way to use the MEAN.JS boilerplate is to download a zip copy of the latest MEAN.JS stable version. You can also do this using wget command:
  </p>
  <pre>$ wget https://github.com/meanjs/mean/archive/v0.4.2.zip -O meanjs.zip; unzip meanjs.zip; rm meanjs.zip</pre>
  <p>
    Don't forget to rename mean-0.4.2 after your project name.
  </p>
  <h2>Quick Install</h2>
  <p>
    Once you've installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop you MEAN application.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a <b>package.json</b> file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application, to learn more about the modules installed visit the <a href="#npm">NPM &amp; Package.json</a> section.
  </p>
  <p>
    To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again, just run this in the command-line:
    <pre>$ npm install</pre>
    <br>This command does a few things:
    <ul>
      <li>First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.</li>
      <li>If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.</li>
      <li>Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a
        <code>bower install</code>command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Running Your Application with Grunt</h2>
  <p>
    After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:
    <pre>$ grunt</pre>
    Your application should run on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Running Your Application with Gulp (Optional)</h2>
  <p>
    After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Gulp, just run gulp default task:
    <pre>$ gulp</pre>
    Your application should run on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's it! your application should be running by now, to proceed with your development check the other sections in this documentation.
